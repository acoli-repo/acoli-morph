These files contain the distribution of the computational morphology SMOR 
as they were made public by the IMS Stuttgart in the 1.4.2 release of SFST
in 2011. However, for your convenience, we have made the following changes
wrt Morphisto:
- converted the SMOR source files to UTF-8
- applied the patch smor.patch as distributed with Morphisto's original release

You can find the original sources at:
