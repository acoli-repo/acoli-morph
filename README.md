# Morphological resources in OntoLex-Morph

idea:
- represent all major types of morphological resources in OntoLex
- inflectional morphology of an OntoLex entry (morphosyntactic features)
- derivational morphology of an OntoLex entry (morphological segmentation plus linguistic analysis)
- morphological rules

OntoLex-Morph is still under development, so this is explorative work, mostly. The vocabulary may change.
