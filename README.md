# Morphological resources in OntoLex-Morph

idea:
- represent all major types of morphological resources in OntoLex
- inflectional morphology of an OntoLex entry (morphosyntactic features)
- derivational morphology of an OntoLex entry (morphological segmentation plus linguistic analysis)
- morphological rules

phenomena covered:
- [`uder/`](uder): derivation, sample conversion for German
- [`unimorph/`](unimorph): inflection, smaple conversion for German
- [`germanet/`](germanet): compounding, German only

OntoLex-Morph is still under development, so this is explorative work, mostly. The vocabulary may change.
