The Universal Morphology (UniMorph) project is a collaborative effort to improve how NLP handles complex morphology in the world's languages. The goal of UniMorph is to annotate morphological data in a universal schema that allows an inflected word from any language to be defined by its lexical meaning, typically carried by the lemma, and by a rendering of its inflectional form in terms of a bundle of morphological features from our schema.

Plus, we're now available in a [Python package](https://pypi.org/project/unimorph/)!

	$> pip install unimorph
